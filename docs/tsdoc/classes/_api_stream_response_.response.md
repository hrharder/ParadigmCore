# Class: Response

The `Response` class represents a JSONRPC server response. It includes safety checks to ensure messages sent by the server conform to the JSONRPC-2.0 spec.

To construct a **valid** response object, pass in an options object with an `id` and `result` field. The `id` should be the same as the string provided by the client when the request was initially made.

To construct an **invalid** (i.e. error) response object, only pass in the `error` field in the `options` object (to the constructor). The id will automatically be filled in as `null` as per the JSONRPC 2.0 spec.

## Constructors

###  constructor

⊕ **new Response**(options: *`IResponseOptions`*): [Response](_api_stream_response_.response.md)

*Defined in [api/stream/Response.ts:58](https://github.com/paradigmfoundation/paradigmcore/blob/f520b2a/src/api/stream/Response.ts#L58)*

Create a new response object.

Only include `options.id` and `options.result` for requests that do not illicit an error.

Requests that result in errors (validation or otherwise) will result in response objects with an `id` field of `null` and have no `result`. Only pass in `options.error` for error responses.

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| options | `IResponseOptions` |  response options object (see \[\[IResponseOptions\]\]) |

**Returns:** [Response](_api_stream_response_.response.md)
